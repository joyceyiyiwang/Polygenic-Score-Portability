# `scripts` Folder

## `00_make_directories.sh`

This file creates some subdirectories under the same directory where this file is located, in the following structure:

- `data`
  - `ambiguous_indel_snps`
  - `intersecting_filtered`
  - `kgp_filtered`
  - `kgp_merged`
  - `kgp_meta`
  - `ukb_filtered`
  - `ukb_merged`
  - `ukb_meta`
  - `ukb_populations`
  - `models`
  - `phenotypes`
  - `gwas_results`
  - `prs`
  - `kgp_populations`
  - `fst`
  - `LDpred`
    - `prs`
    - `tmp-data`
    - `val_prs`
  - `prs_comparisons`
  - `theory`
  - `theor_herit`
  - `theoretical`
- `img`

For me, these directories are under `$WORK2/pgs_portability`

## `01_UKBB_genotypes_filtered.sh`

This file filters out the indels and ambiguous variants.

I had to copy the files from `/corral-repl/utexas/Recombining-sex-chro/ukb/data/genotype_calls/` into my directory for this script to work, or it will throw a `FileNotFoundError`.

I'm working on getting the .sam file from BioBank.
